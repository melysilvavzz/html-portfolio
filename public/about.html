<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! my name is Melissa Silva, I am 18 years old and I am currently studying computer science at UDEM. </p>

<p>One of my favorite hobbies of all time is to cook, specially baking. I usually do all sorts of desserts, from cookies, to brownies, and even cinnamon rolls. I am usually a very energetic person, that also loves working in teams, has good communication with others and is responsable.</p>

<p>I have been learning programming in C++ and recently purchased a course to learn all about web development, and all I can say is that im loving it. I hope I keep learning everyday!</p>
